### Data Analyst | Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer
## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
I'm deeply passionate about harnessing the potential of data to uncover insights and tackle complex challenges head-on. With a solid background in Business Management and extensive expertise in Advanced Data Analytics and machine learning, I thrive in collaborative settings where I can apply my analytical skills to address real-world problems with innovation and precision.

## üìä Current Projects
Project 1: Classification of TikTok videos
- Overview:TikTok is exploring the application of machine learning to extract claims or propositions from videos and comments on its platform. Leveraging statsmodels and scikit-learn, the goal is to classify each data point as either a claim or opinion. This initiative aims to enhance the triaging process for human review, facilitating more efficient content moderation on TikTok.
- Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
  
Project 2: Classification of Waze data
- Overview: The Waze data team is working on a data analytics project focused on reducing monthly user churn on the Waze app to drive overall growth. By leveraging decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost algorithms, the team aims to predict user churn and implement targeted strategies to retain users. 
- Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, XGBoost

Project 3: Automatidata
- Overview: New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission has contracted the Automatidata data team to build a machine learning model to predict whether a NYC TLC taxi cab rider will be a generous tipper.  
- Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, XGBoost
